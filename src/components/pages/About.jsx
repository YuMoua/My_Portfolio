      <p>
        My name is Youzong Moua and I have been officially coding for roughly six months now. I started this in the beginning due to my interests in gaming and computers. Wanting to know more,
        I learned about it myself starting with RPGMaker and online learning tutorials for webdevelopment. Being a light hobby, it wasn't until I learned of Bootcamps that I decided to 
        professionally become a web developer.

        In the beginning, it was quite hard as the pace of the class was quite fast and the learning curve rose higher each week. Thanks to my instructor and TA's however, I was able
        to understand the curriculum and begin to understand more in depth about the field of web development. 
      </p>

        Now with the knowledge I have, I like to think about future projects of my own. Building my own website and even games when possible.
        Though I will keep up with my other hobbies like reading and writing novels.
